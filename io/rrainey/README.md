## Io Notes

### General
- Upper vs Lower case variables
  - >Types in Io are just conveniences. Idiomatically, an object that begins with an uppercase name is a type, so Io sets the type slot. Any clones of that type starting with lowercase letters will simply invoke their parentsâ€™ type slot. Types are just tools that help Io programmers better organize code.
- A method is an object, just like any other type of object. You can get its type:
  ```
  Io> method() type
  ==> Block
  ```
- `true`, `false` and `nil` are singletons
  ```
  Io> true clone ==> true
  Io> false clone ==> false
  Io> nil clone ==> nil
  ```
- Don't do this: `Object clone := "hosed"`. Now your process can no
  longer clone anything.

### List and Maps

Io has a few types of collections. A list is an ordered collection of objects of any type. List is the prototype for all lists, and Map is the prototype for key-value pairs, like the Ruby hash.
